# Text-Analytics-on-Tedx-Talk
This analysis was carried out on a ted-talk of two speakers using R programming language.
The speakers whose talks weere analysed are Deborah Gordon and Catherine Mohr.
The analysis was on words that are considered as negative, positive or neutral.
Catherine Mohr and Deborah Gordon in their respective talks, tries to introduces us into their Worlds of Science, with Mohr specifically talking about green energy, the future of robotics in surgery and how she became a part sea urchin, narrowing it to her love life. On the other hand, Gordon talked so well about her interest in the Ant colony and how it can be referenced into our work space, drawing lessons about what it teaches about the brain, cancer and the internet and what living inside the colony would look like.
